This sample code is designed for assignment3 of CS460/560
OS: Linux
---------------------------------------------------------

In case you didn't use glut for previous assignments, I attached library files for freeglut in 'dependencies' folder.
If you never have glut installed in your system path, please include library search path by:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/dependencies/lib

We run above command just to make sure the shared library (libglut.so) is linked to the project. 


TO BUILD and RUN:

$ make
$./project
